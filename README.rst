If you know of a bug that should be on this list, please do send a pull request!

My bias in the list is towards bugs that are more "how is that even possible" kinds of bugs than pure "face-palming" bugs, though sometimes the line between the two is blurry.
But e.g., the Gemini 5 spacecraft crashed because it had the wrong value for an important constant used to fly it -- a terrible and critical bug, but not one for the list above.

The bias is also towards technical detail, so bug reports over storytelling.
If there are both available for a particular bug, definitely include the bug report and diagnosis.

But any bug so interesting it's questionable for inclusion is worth considering!
