Contributing

If you know of a bug that should be on this list, please do send a pull
request!

My bias in the list is towards bugs that are more "how is that even
possible" kinds of bugs than pure "face-palming" bugs, though sometimes
the line between the two is blurry. But e.g., the Gemini 5 spacecraft
crashed because it had the wrong value for an important constant used to
fly it -- a terrible and critical bug, but not one for the list above.

The bias is also towards technical detail, so bug reports over
storytelling. If there are both available for a particular bug,
definitely include the bug report and diagnosis.

But any bug so interesting it's questionable for inclusion is worth
considering!
